# PenCrafted

## Overview

PenCrafted is a creative writing website designed to inspire and support writers of all levels. Inspired by the functionality of EverNote, PenCrafted offers a user-friendly platform where you can craft and organize your writing projects. Whether you want to keep your work private or share it with the PenCrafted community for constructive criticism, PenCrafted provides the tools you need to enhance your writing journey.

## Project Journey

PenCrafted is my Capstone project for AppAcademy, developed within a challenging two-week timeframe. Throughout this project, I aimed to create a platform that nurtures creativity and community among writers. While time constraints prevented me from implementing all aspects of my vision, this project successfully offers an intuitive user experience with a clean and elegant design. I am committed to continuing the development of PenCrafted and enhancing its features in the future.
