- Walk through the landing page and find any issues with insite
    - check sign up modals
    - check any links
    - adjust bottom links to open a new web page


- loging in with center button is good
    - validations are good
    - password clears if it is wrong

- still asks for email on sign up


- put a loading sign or a wait on returning the value of the home page
