- Walk through the landing page and find any issues with insite
    - check sign up modals
    - check any links
    - adjust bottom links to open a new web page


- loging in with center button is good
    - validations are good
    - password clears if it is wrong

- still asks for email on sign up


- put a loading sign or a wait on returning the value of the home page


- get all users will not run if it has login required on it.
    - the current user is not considered authenticated

- figure out how to keep the format of the text when saving the information


- comments are full CRUD - they need to be reviewed
- notebooks -
    - can see notebooks
    - can edit a notebook
        - should we have a delete and edit on the individual page?
    - can delete a notebook
        - deletes well from the home page, should we have a delete and edit on the individual page?
    - can create a notebook
        - There are no validations on the modal but it runs really quickly
- entries -
    - can see entries
        - The public ones need to be mapped out on the home page
        - The preview button 'works' - need to find a way to save styling of text
    - The save button for the edit does not work.
    - The delete button deletes the notebook it is associated with
    - create an entry just gives a popup alert
- Posts -
    - Can see posts on the public feed
        - They should be in order by date
        - would like to have 2 more spots in the dropdown, today and in the last week
            - eventyally I would like to change those up to the most liked and most commented
        - do we want to have another way to get to personal posts in the nav bar?
    - Can remove a post from the public feed page
        - after deleting on the entry page it is not set to private but the publish/private button on the entries page does not work
    - Creating a new post does not work
        - the publish/private button on the entries page does not work
    - Can edit a post from the home page
        - do we want to be able to edit a post from the post page or the public feed?


- the home button in the nav does not work if it is open  only if it is closed



- Eventually, set it to where if you click on any button or link outside of the edit entry form
    it will have the popup modal, we are just sticking with everywhere outside for now

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE -

Landing Page
    - clean up the modals
    - add background image (if you have time)

On Login
    - When we login we come to the same page we were on when we signed out - do we care about this

Left Nav Bar
    - when we click onto a notebook card the nav for it's name does not light up
