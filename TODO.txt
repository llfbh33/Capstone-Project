WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE -

Landing Page
    - clean up the modals
    - add background image (if you have time)

On Login
    - When we login we come to the same page we were on when we signed out - do we care about this

Left Nav Bar
    - when we click onto a notebook card the nav for it's name does not light up


- for some reason the entry edit is doing auto save


first walk through full crud - then validations

- new notebook creation needs validations


- So that Brian can pregrade
    - Making an entry public from the entry page does not work yet


- comments in the entry pages do not show up when you are editing but do on the preview page, switch this?
- the commenters profile images do not show on the comments on the entry pages













- login modal - the error message for wrong password does not go away


- Go through each modal and adjust accordingly
- comment out all tabs on left nav bar that will not be used
